## Prerequisites

To build and run this Hugo site locally, you need to have the following installed:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (Extended version)
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install/)

Without these dependencies, the site may not build correctly or some features might not work as expected.

Also, make sure you initialize and update submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
