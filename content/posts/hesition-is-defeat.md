title: 'Hesition Is Defeat'
---

people operate because of a perceived optionality, due to social media. the internet makes people think they have more options than they actually do. But this causes them to hesitate, because there may be something better out there in the future.

better jobs, better relationships, better opportunities … we are constantly searching for something better. funnily enough we are not necessarily built for having many options, it causes us to freeze. it causes us to hesitate.

you need to know what to do, because you need to make progress, and feel fulfilled, but what do you know? you’ll probably make the wrong decision. that’s why you need to commit to something, because then you will know whether it was right or wrong. you're allowed to change your mind. not all decisions are irreversible.

in a couple months or years, you can probably go back, if the decision was wrong, anyway. hesitancy will hold you back. You need to decide what you want.
