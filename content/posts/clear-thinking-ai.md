There's a chain reaction most people miss:

Clear thinking → Clear writing → Clear prompting

Each step refines the one before it. Writing forces you to confront the gaps in your thinking. Prompting forces you to confront the gaps in your writing.

AI amplifies whatever you input. Feed it muddy thinking, get muddy outputs. Feed it precision, get leverage.

## The Surplus of Competence

We're drowning in tools that enable a base level of competence. AI is one of them. Anyone can generate "pretty good" now - content, code, strategy, whatever.

But the outsized returns won't come from the tools themselves. They'll come from clear thinking, which enables the tools to be used well.

## Running vs Tennis

Think of it this way:

Running is an endurance sport. No strategy required - just pure effort. More miles, more results.

Tennis is different. It's precision of movement combined with strategy. Same with golf, same with any team sport that has a position of leverage - the quarterback, the top scorer, the pitcher.

You need:
- Precision
- Strategy
- Refinement of that strategy
- *Then* high volume until it's perfected

## Ideas Work the Same Way

This is what enables LLMs to do extremely efficient work - and it's also what makes them dangerous. The tool amplifies even the worst ideas. Garbage in, garbage out, at scale.

But here's the upside: you get faster feedback. Your "shots on goal" increase dramatically. You can iterate on ideas in hours instead of weeks.

## The Real Goal

While everyone else takes a quantity-based strategy - cranking out volume and hoping something hits - there's a better path:

1. Magnify the quality of your inputs
2. Refine them toward perfection
3. *Then* scale with AI

The goal isn't high volume. The goal is **high-quality volume**.

AI enables the volume. The human enables the quality.

That division of labor is the gap between great leaders and average ones. Great engineers and average ones. Great entrepreneurs and everyone chasing the same opportunities with the same tools.

The tools are available to everyone. Clear thinking is not.
