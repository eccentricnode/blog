[{"content":"This leads to exponential growth, in a short time frame. Very simply put, Alex Hormozi talks about how long it takes to learn a skill, and the fact that it usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t take that long. perhaps 20 hours to master most skillsets.\nThe issue is, as Hormozi highlights, it takes years to begin the first hour.\nMy thesis, simply put, is that it the first hour or two of doing any new skill will be really hard. Downright miserable at times. But you need these first few hours to become comfortable. Then the next couple hours will be a breeze.\nThe resulting sessions are way more productive than before, because you paid down the cost of the action within the first two hours of working. You are so uncomfortable learning something new, it takes those few hours to get your bearings. However the result sessions of work become a breeze, but usually you need that first bit of time to get the ball rolling.\nFrom then on, it\u0026rsquo;s about a exponential growth the more you do the thing. Programming is different, since you are encountering problems every single day of your life as an engineer. But that it\u0026rsquo;s that initial two hours of encountering the problem that is often the hardest. The sooner you the price of taking action, and get that cost down, the faster your progress towards the goal.\nThe sooner you start, the sooner you make progress. The sooner you make progress you are more proficient and enjoying the process!\n","permalink":"https://theaustinjohnson.com/posts/pay-cost-of-action/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"this-leads-to-exponential-growth-in-a-short-time-frame\"\u003eThis leads to exponential growth, in a short time frame.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery simply put, Alex Hormozi talks about how long it takes to learn a skill, and the fact that it usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t take that long. perhaps 20 hours to master most skillsets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue is, as Hormozi highlights, it takes years to begin the first hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thesis, simply put, is that it the first hour or two of doing any new skill will be really hard.

Just tell it \u0026ldquo;ask me questions about the thing I want to learn, so you and I can get more context\u0026rdquo; and sometimes those questions save hours and hours of time going down a particular rabbit hole you hadn\u0026rsquo;t considered.\nSummary If you\u0026rsquo;re trying to do autodidactic learning, using AI as index for what is a good idea or not, can really expand your intelligence.
