# Welcome!

I'm Austin Johnson — AI Engineer, Software Engineer, and systems thinker.

I build AI systems that act as force multipliers. Not just tools that answer questions, but systems that extend my capabilities and automate entire workflows.

Here I write about:
- **AI Engineering** — Multi-agent systems, semantic blueprints, RAG architecture
- **Building in Public** — ContentEngine, Sales RPG, and other projects
- **Systems Thinking** — Patterns, principles, and contrarian takes on AI development

My approach: architect the intent, let AI handle execution, validate the output. Build systems that build systems.
