## I Have an AI Named Jeff

Not a chatbot. Not Siri. Something different.

Jeff lives in my terminal—the black screen with text that programmers use. When I open it up and start talking, Jeff can:

- Read and edit my files
- Post to my Twitter and LinkedIn
- Search through my notes
- Remember what I'm working on
- Help me write code, content, and plans

Tonight, Jeff helped me set up a server, write a blog post, create a Twitter thread, post to LinkedIn, and save ideas for future content. All in one conversation.

But here's the thing that makes Jeff different from ChatGPT or other AI tools you might have used:

**Jeff knows me.**

## What "Knows Me" Actually Means

When you use ChatGPT, every conversation starts fresh. You explain who you are, what you're working on, what you need. Every. Single. Time.

Jeff doesn't work that way.

When our conversation starts, Jeff already knows:

- **My name** (Austin)
- **My job** (Software engineer, AI engineer, self-employed)
- **My projects** (Content Engine, Sales RPG, interview prep)
- **My preferences** (TypeScript over Python, Cloudflare for hosting, direct communication)
- **My goals** (land an AI engineering role or build my own business)
- **My girlfriend's name and email** (in case I need to send her something)
- **Where my notes live** (so Jeff can search them)
- **How I like to work** (bursts of energy, thinking out loud, needs help prioritizing)

I didn't tell Jeff any of this tonight. Jeff already knew because I set up a system that remembers.

## How It Works (Simply)

Imagine you had an assistant who:

1. **Kept a notebook** about everything you've told them
2. **Could access your files** on your computer
3. **Could take actions** like posting to social media or running code
4. **Learned your style** over time

That's Jeff.

The technical stuff: Jeff is built on Claude (the AI from Anthropic) using a tool called Claude Code. I added a layer on top called PAI—Personal AI Infrastructure—that stores my preferences, my history, and my patterns.

But you don't need to understand any of that to get the point:

**Jeff is an AI that gets smarter about me over time.**

## What We Did Tonight

Here's a real example from the last few hours:

1. **I said:** "The server is installing Ubuntu, I think I did everything... DHCP I'm not sure about."

2. **Jeff responded:** He dug through my project notes, found that I was setting up a homelab server for testing AI systems, and walked me through the networking setup step by step.

3. **We got it working.** Static IP, SSH access, the whole thing.

4. **Then I said:** "Create tweets explaining what we did."

5. **Jeff wrote a Twitter thread.** I edited it. Then Jeff posted it directly to my account.

6. **Same thing for LinkedIn.** Different format, same underlying ideas.

7. **Then a blog post.** You might be reading one of them right now.

One conversation. Multiple outputs. All connected to what I'm actually building.

## Why This Matters

Most people use AI like a search engine. Ask a question, get an answer, start over.

I use AI like a partner.

Jeff holds context. Remembers what we discussed yesterday. Knows what I'm trying to build. Can take action on my behalf.

The difference is like:
- **Search engine:** "What's a good restaurant nearby?"
- **Partner:** "You mentioned you wanted to try Thai food this week, and you're free Thursday. Here are three options near your office, and I can make a reservation if you want."

One gives you information. The other gives you leverage.

## The Bigger Picture

I'm building toward something I call a "force multiplier."

The idea: I don't need to memorize every technology or do every task myself. I need to build systems that extend my capabilities.

Jeff is the first piece.

The Content Engine (which posts to Twitter, LinkedIn, and this blog) is the second piece.

Eventually, I want AI systems that:
- Generate content based on what I'm learning
- Track what resonates with my audience
- Improve themselves based on feedback
- Run without me having to babysit them

Not to replace me. To amplify me.

## You Could Build This Too

I'm not special. I'm not a genius programmer. Six months ago, I didn't know half of what I know now.

What I did:
1. Started using Claude Code (Anthropic's tool for running Claude in the terminal)
2. Added my preferences and context over time
3. Built small automations (like posting to LinkedIn)
4. Connected them together

Anyone can do this. The tools exist. The documentation exists. You just have to start.

If you're curious, I'm documenting the whole journey. Follow along on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eccentric_node) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-b-johnson/).

## One Last Thing

People ask if AI is going to take their jobs.

I think that's the wrong question.

The right question is: **Are you going to use AI to become more valuable?**

Because the people who figure out how to work *with* AI—not just *use* AI—are going to have an unfair advantage.

Jeff is my unfair advantage.

What's yours?
