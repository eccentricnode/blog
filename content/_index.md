# Welcome!

I am Full-Stack Software Engineer, with an interest in self-development. Here, I post about everything, Software, Tech, Philosophy, maybe some religion at points.

### I also work as Physical Trainer! 
If you are interested in being trained check this [link](/training), for more about what I can offer you!
