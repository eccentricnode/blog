title: 'If You Are Not Careful, Your Notes Will Undo Your Learning'
---

Notes are supposed to help you learn. They can do the opposite.

Most people take notes to capture knowledge. They highlight, summarize, organize. They build elaborate systems with tags and links and beautiful formatting. And at the end of it all, they've learned almost nothing.

The problem isn't the notes. The problem is the mindset behind them.

## What Cramming Actually Is

Cramming isn't just "going fast" or "studying before a test." It's a deeper pattern:

**Cramming is the illusion that consumption is learning.**

It's the belief that exposure equals understanding. That if you read enough, highlight enough, capture enough - knowledge will somehow transfer into your brain through osmosis.

It won't.

At its core, cramming is **avoidance of crystallizing thought**. And crystallizing thought requires something deeply uncomfortable: **making decisions about what you believe.**

When you cram, you don't have to decide anything. You just consume. You absorb. You collect. The information flows through you, and you mistake that flow for learning.

Real learning requires you to stop and say: "Here's what I think about this. Here's what it means to me. Here's how it connects to what I already know."

That's a decision. And decisions are uncomfortable.

## Why We're Trapped In This Pattern

The education system trained us for this.

Think about how school works: there's always a **right answer**. The teacher knows it. The textbook contains it. Your job is to absorb it and repeat it back.

You never had to decide what you think. You never struggled with genuine uncertainty. You never made a judgment call and faced real feedback about whether your reasoning was sound.

The system decided the "happy path" for you. You followed it. No struggle. No real decisions. No differentiation of your own thinking.

So when you encounter new information as an adult, you default to the same pattern: consume it, capture it, organize it. Surely if you collect enough of the right information, learning will happen.

It doesn't work that way.

Problems in the real world aren't multiple choice. There isn't always a right answer. And even when there is, finding it requires judgment - the very thing we were never trained to develop.

**We're uncomfortable making our own decisions because we were taught there's always someone who knows better.**

## Hermann Ebbinghaus Proved This (And We Ignored It)

In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus became the "godfather of learning theory" by studying pure memory. He created 2,300 nonsense syllables - consonant-vowel-consonant combinations like "WUX" or "CAZ" with zero meaning. He spent years memorizing these meaningless fragments to study memory without the interference of context or connection.

His research discovered the forgetting curve (we lose 60% of information within 9 hours) and the spacing effect (distributed learning beats cramming).

But here's what nobody talks about: **Ebbinghaus found that meaningful material - like a poem - was 10 times easier to remember than his nonsense syllables.**

He literally proved that isolated, meaningless information is terrible for retention. He proved that information connected to existing knowledge sticks dramatically better.

**And education systems adopted the method of his experiments (rote memorization of isolated facts) instead of the insight from his results (meaningful learning is superior).**

Why? Because rote memorization requires no decisions. Just absorb the right answer. Don't think about what it means. Don't connect it to your own understanding. Don't struggle with whether you agree or disagree.

We took the worst part of his research and made it the default approach to learning - because the worst part was the easiest. It asked nothing of us except exposure.

## How Your Notes Undo Your Learning

Here's the trap: **you can bring this same cramming mindset into the most sophisticated note-taking system in the world.**

I know because I did it for over a year.

I adopted Zettelkasten - a system specifically designed for slow, deliberate thinking and connection-building. It's fundamentally opposed to cramming. And yet I turned it into just another way to avoid making decisions.

I would consume material and immediately create "perfect notes." Beautifully formatted. Extensively linked. Atomic and pristine. Three hours to process a thirty-minute course. Perfect notes. Complete exhaustion. Zero retention.

I had transformed a writing system into a consumption system. Same avoidance of real thinking. Same illusion of productivity. Just prettier notes.

**The system wasn't the problem. My mindset was.**

(I wrote about this mistake in detail in [I Spent a Year Using Zettelkasten Wrong](/posts/zettelkasten-revelation) - how I destroyed a writing system by treating it like a note-taking system.)

Without a fundamental mindset shift, your note-taking system becomes the very crammy approach it was designed to prevent. The cramming mindset will infect any tool you use.

### The Two Traps

The cramming mindset shows up in two distinct ways, and both are decision avoidance in disguise:

**Trap 1: Always Consuming, Never Outputting**

You read. You highlight. You capture. You organize. You consume more.

But you never write anything in your own words. You never crystallize what you think. You never create main notes that represent your actual understanding.

This is avoidance of the question: **"What do I actually think about this?"**

That question requires a decision. So you keep consuming instead. Your inbox overflows. Your notebooks pile up. You feel productive. You learn nothing.

If you're grinding through material - or as my friend Mischa calls it, "panicking through it" - you're not learning. You're avoiding the uncomfortable work of deciding what any of it means.

**Trap 2: Perfect Notes About Everything**

You create beautiful, detailed notes about every topic you encounter. You spread yourself across dozens of subjects, capturing everything, processing nothing deeply.

You end up going a mile wide and an inch deep. Touching everything, thinking about nothing.

This is avoidance of commitment. If you go deep on one thing, you have to make decisions about it. You have to stake a position. You might be wrong.

So instead, you go wide. You create perfect notes about everything. You feel productive. But you're just regurgitating information with better formatting.

The notes you create while consuming look like this:
- "Machine learning: algorithms that enable computers to learn from data"
- "Kubernetes uses a control plane to manage worker nodes"
- "The forgetting curve shows memory decay over time"

These are definitions. Explanations. What the source says. They're reference notes disguised as permanent notes.

Real synthesis - real learning - looks like this:
- "The 'learning' metaphor in ML is misleading because it obscures that machines optimize statistical patterns rather than reason. This matters for debugging AI systems - I need probabilistic thinking, not deterministic troubleshooting."

This is YOUR thinking. It connects to YOUR context. It says something the source didn't say. It required you to make a decision about what the information means.

**Both traps share the same root: avoiding the uncomfortable work of deciding what you think.**

## The Distinction That Solves This

The Zettelkasten method - done correctly - solves this by separating two completely different types of cognitive work:

**Reference Notes (Capture)**
- What the source says
- Quick, messy, no decisions required
- Designed to point back to original material
- Can sit for months or years - they're patient, they wait

**Main Notes (Crystallization)**
- What YOU think about what the source says
- Requires decisions about meaning, connection, relevance
- Written in your own words - your understanding, not a summary
- Created in separate sessions, when you're ready to think

**Connecting Notes (Integration)**
- How your main notes relate to each other
- Another layer of decisions about relationships and tensions
- Where surprising insights emerge

**These are separate tasks. They cannot happen simultaneously.**

When you try to crystallize while consuming, you do neither well. You're too distracted by incoming information to think deeply, and too focused on "processing" to actually finish the material.

The separation gives you permission to consume without deciding (reference notes) and decide deliberately later (main notes).

### Why Reference Notes Change Everything

Here's where this gets counterintuitive: **consuming information quickly isn't actually the problem.**

The beauty of a reference system is that you can go as fast as you like. Capture quick notes while consuming. Mark what's interesting. Finish the course. You can always come back to those reference notes later - they're a permanent archive pointing back to the original material.

**Reference notes are patient. They wait.**

You can consume as widely as your context demands right now. Ten feet wide and three feet deep might be perfectly reasonable - or it might still be too much. It depends.

It depends on your circumstances. Your goals. What else is happening in your life. Just got laid off? Maybe you need to consume broadly across multiple domains to figure out your next move. Building one specific project? Go narrow and deep.

Your context changes. Your circumstances change. What's "too wide" today might be exactly right tomorrow.

Reference notes accommodate this uncertainty. They don't demand decisions. They sit in your archive, ready when you need them - in four months, or two years, whenever you're ready to crystallize.

**The problem isn't consuming widely. The problem is trying to synthesize everything you consume in the moment.**

That's what creates the exhaustion. That's what produces regurgitation instead of thinking. That's what turns your notes into another form of cramming.

Consume as wide as your context demands. Crystallize as deep as your goals require. Keep them separate.

### Why Main Notes Force Real Learning

Main notes are where the actual learning happens. And they work precisely because **you cannot create them without making decisions.**

When you write a main note - in your own words, representing your actual thinking - you have to decide:

- What does this actually mean?
- How does it connect to what I already know?
- Do I agree or disagree with this?
- Why does this matter to my work, my projects, my life?
- What's the tension between this idea and others I hold?

These questions don't have "right answers" you can look up. They require judgment. They require you to stake a position. They require you to think.

The crystallization of main notes as fundamental thought, in your own words, is how you actually "write about" something - not summarize it, not paraphrase it, but process it through your own understanding.

This solves the cramming problem because it forces the very thing cramming avoids: decision-making about meaning.

### Why Connecting Notes Compounds The Effect

Creating main notes isn't the end. The real power comes from connecting them - seeing how one idea relates to another, finding tensions, building chains of thought that surprise you.

This is yet another layer of decision-making. You're deciding: How do these ideas relate? What's the conflict between them? What new understanding emerges from holding them together?

This is the work that generates genuine insight. And it's impossible if you're still trapped in the cramming mindset, consuming without crystallizing.

## Writing Is How You Differentiate Your Thinking

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **writing requires delving into the unknown.**

When you write in your own words - not summarize, not paraphrase, but actually think on paper - you have to:

- Trust your gut about what matters
- Make judgments you might be wrong about
- Stake positions you might have to revise
- Expose gaps in your understanding
- Sit with uncertainty instead of rushing to the "right answer"

This is uncomfortable. It's supposed to be uncomfortable.

The education system trained you to avoid this discomfort by always providing the answer. But real learning happens in the struggle of forming your own understanding.

**Writing is how you make mistakes explicitly.** And explicit mistakes can be corrected. The implicit "mistakes" of never forming an opinion in the first place - those just compound into ignorance disguised as knowledge.

Real learning happens through elaboration - pulling on the strings underneath to understand the "why" behind things:

- What does this actually mean?
- How does it connect to what I already know?
- What's the difference between this and that similar concept?
- Why does it work this way?

When you elaborate on a topic through writing, it's impossible not to learn. You're forced to make decisions. You're forced to crystallize thought. You're forced to do the uncomfortable work that cramming lets you avoid.

The mistakes are inevitable. The decisions are inevitable. The discomfort is inevitable.

You can avoid them through endless consumption, or you can face them through deliberate crystallization. Only one leads to actual learning.

## The Two-Phase Approach

The solution isn't to slow down everything. It's to separate two distinct phases:

**Phase 1: Capture (Go Fast, No Decisions)**
- Consume material at whatever pace makes sense
- Take quick reference notes (what the source says)
- Mark what's interesting
- Finish the material
- Don't try to synthesize yet
- Reference notes will wait for you

**Phase 2: Crystallize (Go Deep, Make Decisions)**
- Later, in a separate session, review your reference notes
- Ask: "What do I THINK about this?"
- Write main notes representing YOUR thinking, in your own words
- Connect to your existing ideas
- Make decisions about meaning, relevance, relationships
- Go an inch wide, a mile deep

The first phase can be fast. The second phase must be slow and deliberate.

When you try to do both simultaneously, you get neither. You're too slow to finish material and too fast to think deeply. You exhaust yourself doing neither well.

## The Shift

Stop mistaking consumption for learning. Stop using notes as a more sophisticated form of cramming. Stop avoiding the decision about what you actually think.

**During consumption:**
1. Take quick reference notes (what the source says)
2. Don't worry about formatting or synthesis
3. Goal: Finish the material
4. Trust that reference notes will wait

**During crystallization (later, separately):**
1. Ask: "What do I think about what I captured?"
2. Write main notes in your own words - not summaries, your actual thinking
3. Make decisions about meaning and connection
4. Connect to existing ideas in your system
5. Trust your gut. Be wrong. Revise later.

**When connecting:**
1. Look for relationships between your main notes
2. Ask: "How do these ideas relate? What's the tension? What emerges?"
3. Build chains of thought that surprise you

The goal isn't to consume more information faster.

The goal isn't to create more notes about more topics.

The goal is to crystallize thought through writing. To make decisions. To differentiate your thinking from what you consumed.

**That requires discomfort. It requires uncertainty. It requires trusting yourself to form judgments even when you might be wrong.**

Your notes can help you do this, or they can help you avoid it.

The cramming mindset uses notes to avoid decisions - endless consumption, perfect notes about everything, never crystallizing thought.

The learning mindset uses notes to make decisions explicit - patient reference notes that wait, deliberate main notes that force thinking, connections that build understanding.

Choose carefully. Your learning depends on it.
